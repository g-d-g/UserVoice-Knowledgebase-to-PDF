UserVoice-Knowledgebase-to-PDF
==============================

Requirements

 * PIL (pip install pil)

A Python script that turns a UserVoice knowledgebase into a PDF.

This script has only been tested on two sites, and you have to configure it in the script itself

 * http://help.tryskipper.com/knowledgebase
 * http://help.gaiagps.com/knowledgebase
 
It's Apache-licensed, so do whatever you want with it. 

If we had more time, we'd fix it to be configurable from the command line, and to make prettier PDFs.
